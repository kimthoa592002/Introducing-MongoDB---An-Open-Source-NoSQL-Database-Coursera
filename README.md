# Read me
This repository documents my learning notes and hands-on labs from the
Coursera course **Introducing MongoDB – An Open-Source NoSQL Database**.

All labs were completed using the **Coursera Cloud IDE** environment.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my foundational understanding
of **MongoDB and NoSQL concepts** from a **Data Analyst perspective**.

## 📘 Course Content Overview

In this course, I studied the following topics:

- CAP Theorem and its implications for distributed systems  
- Challenges in data migration to NoSQL databases  
- MongoDB architecture and core components  
- Key benefits of MongoDB  
- Common MongoDB use cases  
- Replication for high availability  
- Horizontal and zone-based sharding for scalability

## 🛠 Hands-on MongoDB Labs (Cloud IDE)

The hands-on labs focus on working directly with MongoDB using the Mongo Shell
(**mongosh**) in a cloud-based IDE.

Lab activities include:

- Creating databases and collections  
- Performing basic CRUD operations  
- Querying documents with filters and projections  
- Updating and deleting documents  
- Understanding how MongoDB supports scalability and availability  

Executed MongoDB commands and lab notes are documented as part of this repository
to provide clear evidence of practical lab work.

## 🎯 Learning Focus

This repository is intended to showcase:

- Practical exposure to MongoDB as a NoSQL database  
- Understanding of MongoDB architecture, replication, and sharding concepts  
- Experience working in a Cloud IDE environment  
- Supporting knowledge for **Data Analyst / BI Analyst** roles where
  familiarity with NoSQL databases is increasingly required  

This repository represents **learning labs and study notes**, not a
production-level engineering project.
